# TriviaGame
A fun head-to-head trivia game that allows you to test your intellectual prowess against a friend.

This program accepts a file containing 10 questions with corresponding answers. It then prompts the users to enter their names and starts the game. It asks the first player 5 questions and prompts him/her to choose the correct answer (in number form). It then compares his/her asnwer with the correct answer. If the user is correct, he/she is rewarded 20 points. It then asks the second player 5 questions, following the same rules of the first player. At the end of the game, the scores are displayed (out of 100 points) and the player with the higher score is declared the winner. 

The question file must be written in the following form:

Question #1   
Answer #1  
Asnwer #2  
Answer #3  
Answer #4  
Correct answer number (1-4)  
Question #2  
Answer #1  
Asnwer #2  
Answer #3  
Answer #4  
Correct answer number (1-4)  
etc.  

I've included an example questions file (trivia.txt) for reference
